**Hi, I'm Ahmed Saif (FoRReal) from Iraq.**

*I'm a student starting my journey in programming.* I like working with computers, tech, and design, and I'm slowly turning those interests into real skills.

**I'm here to learn, experiment, and improve—one project at a time.**

I also enjoy drawing, reading, gaming, and anything tech-related.

This profile is where I share what I build as I grow :)
